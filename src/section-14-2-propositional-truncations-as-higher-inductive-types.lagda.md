```

We have given a specification of the propositional truncation of a type `A`,
and we have seen that this specification by a universal property determines the
propositional truncation up to equivalence if it exists.
However, the propositional truncation is not guaranteed to exist, so we will
add new rules to the type theory that ensure that any type has a propositional
truncation.
We do this by presenting the propositional truncation of a type `A` as a higher
inductive type.
The propositional truncation `∥ A ∥` of a type `A` was one of the first
examples of a higher inductive type, along with the circle, which we will
discuss in Sections `sec:circle` and `sec:circle-universal-cover`.

The idea of higher inductive types is similar to the idea of ordinary inductive
types, with the added feature that constructors of higher inductive types can
also be used to generate *identifications*.
In other words, higher inductive types may be specified by two kinds of
constructors:

1. The *point constructors* are used to generate elements of the higher
   inductive types.
2. The *path constructors* are used to generate identifications between
   elements of the higher inductive type.

The induction principle of the higher inductive type then tells us how to
construct sections of families over it.
The rules for higher inductive types therefore come in four sets, just as the
rules for ordinary inductive types in Section 4.1: the formation rule, the
constructors, the induction principle, and the computation rules.

## The formation rules and the constructors

The formation rule of the propositional truncation postulates that for every
type `A` we can form the propositional truncation of `A`.
The formation rule is therefore as follows:

```text
  Γ ⊢ A type
  --------------
  Γ ⊢ ∥ A ∥ type.
```

Furthermore, we will assume that all universes are closed under propositional
truncations.
In other words, for any universe `𝒰` we will assume the rules

```text
  X : 𝒰 ⊢ ∥ X ∥ : 𝒰
  X : 𝒰 ⊢ 𝒯(∥ X ∥) ≐ ∥ 𝒯(X) ∥ type.
```

The constructors of a higher inductive type tell what structure the type comes
equipped with.
In the case of a higher inductive type there may be point constructors and path
constructors.
The point constructors generate elements of the higher inductive type, and the
path constructors generate identifications between those elements.
In the case of the propositional truncation, there is one point constructor and
one path constructor:

```text
  η : A → ∥ A ∥
  α : Π(x y : ∥ A ∥) x = y.
```

The point constructor `η` is sometimes called the **unit** of the propositional
truncation.
It gives us that any element of `A` also generates an element of `∥ A ∥`.
The path constructor `α` simply identifies any two elements of `∥ A ∥`.
Therefore it follows immediately that `∥ A ∥` is a proposition.

## Lemma 14.2.1

For any type `A`, the type `∥ A ∥` is a proposition.

## The induction principle and computation rules

The induction principle for the propositional truncation tells us how to
construct dependent functions

```text
  h : Π(t : ∥ A ∥) Q(t).
```

The induction principle will imply that such a dependent function `h` is
entirely determined by its behavior on the constructors of `∥ A ∥`.
The type `∥ A ∥` has two constructors: a point constructor `η` and a path
constructor `α`, so we have two cases to consider:

1. Applying `h` to points of the form `η(a)` gives us a dependent function

```text
  h ∘ η : Π(a : A) Q(η(a)).
```

The induction principle of `∥ A ∥` has therefore the requirement that we can
construct

```text
  f : Π(a : A) Q(η(a)).
```

2. To apply `h` to the paths `α(x, y)`, we need to use the dependent action on
   paths from Definition `defn:apd`.
   For each `x y : ∥ A ∥` we obtain an identification

```text
  apd_h(α(x, y)) : tr_Q(α(x, y), h(x)) = h(y)
```

in the type `Q(y)`.
Note, however, that `h(x)` and `h(y)` are not determined by our choice of
`f : Π(a : A) Q(η(a))`.
The second requirement of the induction principle of `∥ A ∥` is therefore
that, no matter what values `h` takes, they must always be related via the
dependent action on paths of `h`.
This second requirement is therefore that

```text
  tr_Q(α(x, y), u) = v
```

for any `u : Q(x)` and `v : Q(y)`.

## Definition 14.2.2

The **induction principle** of the propositional truncation `∥ A ∥` of `A`
asserts that for any family `Q` of types over `∥ A ∥`, if we have

```text
  f : Π(a : A) Q(η(a))
```

and if we can construct identifications

```text
  tr_Q(α(x, y), u) = v
```

for any `u : Q(x)`, `v : Q(y)` and any `x y : ∥ A ∥`, then we obtain a
dependent function

```text
  h : Π(t : ∥ A ∥) Q(t)
```

equipped with a homotopy `h ∘ η ~ f`.

## Remark 14.2.3

In fact, a family `Q` over `∥ A ∥` satisfies the second requirement in the
induction principle of the propositional truncation if and only if `Q` is a
family of propositions.
To see this, simply note that transporting along `α(x, y)` is an embedding.
Therefore we have

```text
  (tr_Q(α(x, y), u) = tr_Q(α(x, y), v)) ≃ (u = v)
```

for any `u v : Q(x)`.
By assumption, there is an identification on the left hand side, so any two
elements `u` and `v` in `Q(x)` are equal.

Since the induction principle of the propositional truncation is only
applicable to families of propositions over `∥ A ∥`, it also follows that
there are no interesting computation rules to state: any identification in a
proposition just holds.

## The universal property

We have now completed the description of the propositional truncation as a
higher inductive type, so it is time to show that it meets the specification we
gave for the propositional truncations.
In other words, we have to show that the map `η : A → ∥ A ∥` satisfies the
universal property of the propositional truncation.

## Theorem 14.2.4

The map `η : A → ∥ A ∥` satisfies the universal property of the propositional
truncation.

## Proof

In order to prove that `η : A → ∥ A ∥` satisfies the universal property of the
propositional truncation of `A`, it suffices to construct a map

```text
  (A → Q) → (∥ A ∥ → Q)
```

for any proposition `Q`.
Consider a map `f : A → Q`.
Then we will construct a function `∥ A ∥ → Q` by the induction principle of the
propositional truncation.
We have to provide a function `A → Q`, which we have assumed already, and we
have to show that

```text
  tr_{λ x → Q}(α(x, y), u) = v
```

for any `u v : Q` and any `x y : ∥ A ∥`.
However, we have such identifications by the assumption that `Q` is a
proposition, so the proof is complete.

One simple application of the universal property of the propositional
truncation is that `∥_∥` acts on functions in a functorial way.

## Proposition 14.2.5

There is a map

```text
  ∥_∥ : (A → B) → (∥ A ∥ → ∥ B ∥)
```

for any two types `A` and `B`, such that

```text
  ∥ id ∥     ~ id
  ∥ g ∘ f ∥ ~ ∥ g ∥ ∘ ∥ f ∥.
```

## Proof

For any `f : A → B`, the map `∥ f ∥ : ∥ A ∥ → ∥ B ∥` is defined to be the
unique extension

```text
  A ----f----> B
  |           |
  η           η
  v           v
  ∥ A ∥ --∥f∥--> ∥ B ∥.
```

To see that `∥_∥` preserves identity maps and compositions, simply note that
`id_{∥ A ∥}` is an extension of `id_A`, and that `∥ g ∥ ∘ ∥ f ∥` is an
extension of `g ∘ f`.
Hence the homotopies are obtained by uniqueness.
